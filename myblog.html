                The line import 'dotenv/config' is a importation of a file from the path dotenv/config. When we use
                the package dotenv, it contains the .env file. In this project it contains the MONGODB connect string
                and the PORT value. Later on we access that PORT value by doing const PORT = process.env.PORT. The 
                purpose of a separate env file from the controller is for security purposes.

                Import Express is used to create web server and handle HTTP requests and responses 
                (user inputs, displaying stuff, routing, etc). Handles the post, get, put, delete HTTP requests 
                through built in functions within Express. Also handles middleware for parsing JSON, 
                logging, authentication, etc.

                ascynHandler is used so that we don't need to write a try and else block of code
                in every async route, it automatically catches errors and passes them to Express's built in error handler. Used in 
                all of our HTTPS requests to save time.

                The * means import everything that module exports as exercises in this case. When we want to call on a 
                function we do exercises.nameoffunction. Tells us which file we're using, the custom name referring to all exports, 
                and which function we're using.

            <h2>The use and listen functions of Express</h2>
            <img src="blog images/use&listen.PNG">
            <p class="article-p">
               app.use is calling on an Express function "use" that registers middleware. It runs on
               every request because it doesn't have a route. If we said app.use('/api') then it only 
               runs on URL that starts with /api. <b>The express.json() is a middleware that helps parse incoming
               JSON data in request body into a JS object </b>(it converts it into a JS object so computer understands).
            </p>
            <p class="article-p">
                The listen function in Express takes in parameter PORT (which we defined earlier) to start the server.
                Once the server starts, it can then wait for HTTP requests and respond to them. The 
                async is a important keyword used when we want asynchronous code to behave like synchronous code.
                The async returns a promise and the await keyword pauses the execution of the async function that 
                contains it. This is helpful because other code of the program can be run during this time, <b>other code 
                outside the function can continue executing</b>. Gives a illusion of synchronous, but is actually asynchronous under the hood. 
            </p>
            <p class="article-p">
               Note: middleware refers to functions that runs during execution of a request and parsing
               means converting data from one format to another.

               When a user enters inputs into a text box, the data gets sent to the server. How the server 
               get these values is through using req.body. And the app.use(express.json()) allows us to convert
               the data given by user into a JSON object, making it accessible via req.body. Also consider any
               limitations the inputs should have, if there's any, define them first. We assure these limits by
               the usage of typeof in a if statement.

            <img src="blog images/model-imports.PNG">
            <p class="article-p">
                A Object Document Mapper (ODM) helps us map programming language's objects and data base documents. 
                <b>ODM helps convert our objects into documents for storing them and converts it back when reading the data.</b>
                The two main things why we use mongoose instead of MongoDB is that it provides schema enforcement
                (we define the schema) and has built in validation. For example, reps: {type: Number, required: true, min: 1}.
                can be defined in our schema and contains built in validation. Other benefits is cleaner syntax, middleware, and more control.
            </p>
            <p class="article-p">
                Mongoose does not include the MongoDB. Therefore we need a MongoDB server running and a connection string to access our database.
                This is done by using the website cloud.mongodb.com to host our server via MongoDB Atlas.
            </p>
            <p class="article-p">
                The important of importing 'dotenv/config' is not to start the server, but to instead connect
                to it. We need to connect to the database in order to access our data by using built in functions of mongoose.

            <h2>How to Connect to Mongoose</h2>
            <p class="article-p">Here's a example of using mongoose connect function taken from mongoosejs.com:</p>
            <img src="blog images/mongoose-connect-example.PNG">
            <p class="article-p">
                The example above connects to the database and uses a catch error. For our project, we want
                to do the same thing but protect our database password and API keys out of our source code.
                Try implementing this using the <b>process</b> core module of Node.js which provides the env property
                that holds/hosts all environment variables.

            <h2>How to Create a Schema</h2>
            <p class="article-p"> 
                To create a schema we use mongoose.Schema(). First, set some constant to mongoose.Schema() to define
                the structure blueprint that we will call for future uses.
                Inside the function we include the objects that we need. Below are a few common schema field options you can use.
            </p>
            <img class="img-center"src="blog images/schema-options.PNG">
            <p class="article-p">
                Afterwards, we use mongoose.model() to create a schema. This function takes in two parameters, the name of collection and the schema.
            </p>
            <p class="article-p">   
                In conclusion: if you were to define const userSchema = mongoose.Schema ({
                type: Number, required: true, min: 1}) and const User = mongoose.model({'user_data', userSchema}).
                You could can then use User to call on query functions such as Model.find() and Model.updateOne(),
                by replacing Model with 'User'. Those are helper functions for CRUD operations.
